    <p>
        Welcome to the Teaching Assistant Assistant. To find the courses in this application please follow the link to
        <a th:href="@{/courses}">courses</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This application makes it easy to sift through lots of student groups that are usually handled manually in some
        spreadsheet. By integrating all data into one web application it is possible to access the information you need
        faster, and make coordinated changes without fear of introducing inconsistencies or errors.
